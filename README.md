# Sales-Performance-Analysis


In this project, I built a comprehensive Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and understand business performance across multiple dimensions. The dataset included sales transactions categorized by product, region, segment, ship mode, and time (monthly and quarterly).

Using various interactive visualizations like bar charts, treemaps, line graphs, and KPI cards, I analyzed:

Sales performance by category (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies)

Top-performing products by revenue

Monthly and quarterly sales trends

Profit distribution by segment and region

Impact of shipping modes on sales and discounts

I also calculated key metrics such as total sales, profit, discount totals, and quantity sold, and used DAX measures to compare trends over time. The dashboard supports business decisions like inventory planning, marketing focus, and pricing adjustments by identifying high-revenue areas and underperforming segments.
